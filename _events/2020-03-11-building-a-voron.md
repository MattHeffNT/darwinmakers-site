Can we build an elite world-class 3D printer from the ground up, right here in the NT? You better believe it!
Mat is going to run us through his recent 3D printer project where he built a printer based on self-sourced design called the Voron.
This is a large, fully-enclosed, moving gantry 3D printer with performance matching industrial printers costing twice as much.
Mat will discuss performance aspects of 3D printing and relevant properties of the Voron design.
He'll also describe the experience of sourcing hundreds of parts from several different countries, war stories from the build process, and recent modifications in pursuit of 3D printing perfection.
